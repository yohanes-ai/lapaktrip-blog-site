WP REST User adds in the 'User Registration' or 'Retrieve Password' function for REST API.
 
== Description ==

If you wish to 'Register User' or 'Retrieve Password' using REST API, *without* exposing Administrator credentials to the Front End application, you are at the right place. Since WordPress 4.7, REST API was natively included in WordPress. 

In order to 'Register User' or 'Retrieve Password', the authentication for a user with 'Administrator' role is required. While this is a delibrately done for security reasons, such implementation makes it very hard for Front End applications to implement a simple 'Register' or 'Sign Up' function.

This plugin fullfills such requirement by extending the existing WordPress REST API endpoints. 

= Usage =

Send a POST request to /wp-json/wp/v2/users/register, including a JSON body with three keys: username, email and password.

Send a POST request to /wp-json/wp/v2/users/lostpassword, including a JSON body with three keys: user_login.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
= Why do I need WP REST User? =
 
If you're planning on using your WordPress website as a Backend, and you're consuming RESTful api, you'll most probably need to Register User via REST API. This is precisely what this plugin does.

= Is it secure? =

Great question! For the time being, this plugin only allows registering user as 'subscriber' role. 'Subscriber' role has very limited capability in terms what WordPress allows him/her to do. From our perspective, subscribers are quite harmless.

= Does it work with WooCommerce? =

Another great question! By default, WordPress registers new user as 'subscriber', while WooCommerce registers new user as 'customer'. 
If you have WooCommerce installed and activated on your WordPress website, this plugin will automatically register user as 'customer' as well.
 
= There's a bug, what do I do? =
